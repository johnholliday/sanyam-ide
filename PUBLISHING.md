## 1. Overview
<!-- release: both -->

Every commit to the master branch is automatically published as a preview version. Official updates require a version change.

This guide differentiates between two version numbers:

- **THEIA_VERSION**: (used variable: {{version}}) The version of Theia used in this release.
- **THEIA_IDE_VERSION**: (used variable: {{ideVersion}}) The Sanyam IDE release version. Depending on the context:
  - If there was **no** Theia release, increment the patch version by 1 (e.g., 1.47.0 -> 1.47.1 or 1.47.100 -> 1.47.101).
  - For a new Theia *minor* release (e.g., 1.48.0), use the same version as Theia.
  - For a new Theia *patch* release (e.g., 1.48.1), use Theia's patch version multiplied by 100 (e.g., 1.48.100).

## 2. Update Package Versions and Theia
<!-- release: both -->

Follow these steps to update dependencies and package versions:

### 2.1. Install build dependencies
<!-- release: both -->

```sh
yarn
```

### 2.2. Update versions
<!-- release: both -->

1. Update the monorepo version to **THEIA_IDE_VERSION** (without creating a Git tag):

   ```sh
   yarn version --no-git-tag-version --new-version {{ideVersion}}
   ```

2. Optional: If there is a new Theia release to consume, update Theia dependencies to **THEIA_VERSION** :

   ```sh
   yarn update:theia {{version}} && yarn update:theia:children {{version}}
   ```

3. Update all package versions to **THEIA_IDE_VERSION** (select in input prompt):

   ```sh
   yarn lerna version --exact --no-push --no-git-tag-version
   ```

4. Update the yarn lock file:

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

### 2.3. Check for mandatory code changes
<!-- release: both -->

Update the code to include everything that should be part of the release:

- Implement all tickets that are located in: <https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide/labels/toDoWithRelease>
- If there was a Theia release:
  - Review breaking changes
  - Check for new built-ins
  - Check sample applications changes
  - Update code as necessary
  - Check for new theia packages to be consumed in the example applications (in case there are no tickets)

### 2.4. Prepare Release PR
<!-- release: both -->

After completing step 2.3, open a PR with your changes <https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide/compare>

   PR Title:

   ```md
   Update to Theia v{{version}}
   ```

   OR (if it is a pure Sanyam IDE version update):

   ```md
   Publish Sanyam IDE {{ideVersion}}
   ```

### 2.5. Mac Artifacts
<!-- release: both -->

- The PR will trigger a verification build that generates two zip files with mac artifacts.
- Download these two zips and replace them in this pre-release: <https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide/releases/tag/pre-release>.
- These unsigned dmgs will be used as input for the Jenkins build.

### 2.6. Merge Release PR & Trigger Jenkins Build
<!-- release: both -->

1. Merge PR

2. ==> Steps 2.4 and 2.5 need to be complete to proceed!

3. Once [CI checks after merge to master are complete](https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide/actions), trigger the Jenkins Release Preview <https://ci.eclipse.org/theia/job/theia-ide-release/> job without parameters.

4. Once 3. is successful the notarize job <https://ci.eclipse.org/theia/job/theia-ide-sign-notarize/> is started automatically.

5. Once 4. is successful it starts the upload job <https://ci.eclipse.org/theia/job/theia-ide-upload/>

  *Note*: Please report if upload fails more than 5 times, we need to investigate!

## 3. Preview, Testing, and Release Process
<!-- release: both -->

Once the PR is merged and the preview build is created, follow these steps for testing and eventual release:

### 3.1 Confirm the new preview version is published (do not promote as stable yet)
<!-- release: both -->

- Check if uploaded versions are complete in in download folder <https://download.eclipse.org/theia/ide-preview/{{ideVersion}}/>
  - e.g. check if the latest files are correct and the artifacts are there (in doubt, compare to previous versions)

### 3.2 Announce Preview Test Phase

Thanks! :thx:
```

## 4. Promote IDE from Preview to Stable Channel
<!-- release: both -->

Promote the IDE using the [Build Job](https://ci.eclipse.org/theia/job/Theia%20-%20Promote%20IDE/).

- Specify the release version in the `VERSION` parameter (e.g., 1.48.0), corresponding to the **THEIA_IDE_VERSION** copied from <https://download.eclipse.org/theia/ide-preview/>.

- Post a comment to announce the official release of the Sanyam IDE:

   ```md
   {{ideVersion}} has been promoted to stable
   ```

  - Update the [Base Preview discussion](#32-announce-preview-test-phase) status table with a checkmark and the version that has been published.

   ```md
   | [Sanyam IDE {{majorMinor}}.x Promoted to Stable](https://download.eclipse.org/theia/ide/1.67.100/) | {{today}} | :white_check_mark: |
   ```

  - Mark the message as the answer.

  - Unpin discussion from the Release Announcement Category.

## 5. Tag the Release Commit
<!-- release: both -->

After promoting the release, tag the release commit as follows:

1. Create the tag:

   ```bash
   git tag v{{ideVersion}} ${SHA of release commit}
   ```

2. Push the tag to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin v{{ideVersion}}
   ```

## 6. Publish Docker Image
<!-- release: both -->

Publish the Docker image by running the [workflow](https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide/actions/workflows/publish-theia-ide-img.yml) from the `master` branch. Use **${THEIA_IDE_VERSION}** as the version.
(We do NOT use the v prefix here in this case currently).

- Check the GH package page if the image was published correctly: <https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide/pkgs/container/theia-ide%2Ftheia-ide>

- Update the [Preview discussion](#32-announce-preview-test-phase) status table

   ```md
   | [Docker image Publish](https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide/pkgs/container/theia-ide%2Ftheia-ide) | {{today}} | :white_check_mark: |
   ```

## 7. Snap Update
<!-- release: both -->

Can be parallel to step 6.
After the IDE is promoted to stable, perform these steps for the snap update:

1. Run [this workflow](https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide-snap/actions/workflows/update.yml) from the `master` branch.
2. After the build succeeded, visit <https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide-snap/pulls> to find the PR that updates to **${THEIA_IDE_VERSION}**.
3. Check out the corresponding branch.
4. Amend the latest commit with your author details:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend --author="Your Name <name@example.com>"
   ```

5. Force push the branch.
6. Verify that all checks pass, and then `rebase and merge`.
7. Confirm the master branch build (Store Publishing) is successful.
8. Check if snap is available <https://snapcraft.io/theia-ide>
9. Update the [Preview discussion](#32-announce-preview-test-phase) status table

   ```md
   | [Snap updated](https://snapcraft.io/theia-ide) | {{today}} | :white_check_mark: |
   ```

## 8. Upgrade Dependencies
<!-- release: both -->

After each release, run the following command to upgrade dependencies:

Keep this upgrade process in a separate PR, as it might require IP Reviews from the Eclipse Foundation and additional time. Also, verify the `electron` version in `yarn.lock` and adjust `electronVersion` in `applications/electron/electron-builder.yml` if it has changed.

To perform the upgrade:

- Run `yarn upgrade` at the root of the repository.
- Fix any compilation errors, typing errors, and failing tests.
- Open a PR with the changes ([example](https://github.com/johnholliday/sanyam-ide/pull/568)).
- The license check review is done via the CI.
- Wait for the "IP Check" to complete ([example](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/iplab/-/issues/22828)).

Performing this after the release helps us to find issues with the new dependencies and gives time to perform a license check on the dependencies.
