## HIPAA Overview

The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996)** establishes national standards for protecting sensitive patient health information. HHS enforces through the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

------

### Covered Entities

- Health plans (insurers, HMOs, government programs)
- Healthcare providers who transmit health information electronically
- Healthcare clearinghouses
- **Business Associates**: contractors/vendors handling PHI on behalf of covered entities

------

### The Three Core Rules

**1. Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 & 164, Subparts A & E)**

- Defines **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: individually identifiable health information in any form
- Establishes patient rights: access, amendment, accounting of disclosures, restriction requests
- Requires **minimum necessary** standard—disclose only what's needed
- Permits use/disclosure for: treatment, payment, healthcare operations (TPO), and 12 national priority situations (public health, law enforcement, etc.)
- Requires written authorization for marketing, sale of PHI, psychotherapy notes

**2. Security Rule (45 CFR Part 160 & 164, Subparts A & C)**

- Applies specifically to **electronic PHI (ePHI)**
- Three safeguard categories:
  - **Administrative**: risk analysis, workforce training, contingency plans, BAAs
  - **Physical**: facility access controls, workstation security, device/media controls
  - **Technical**: access controls, audit controls, integrity controls, transmission security
- Standards are "required" or "addressable" (implement or document why alternative is equivalent)

**3. Breach Notification Rule (45 CFR Part 164, Subpart D)**

- Breach = unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of unsecured PHI
- Notification requirements:
  - **Individuals**: without unreasonable delay, ≤60 days
  - **HHS**: annually if <500 affected; within 60 days if ≥500
  - **Media**: if ≥500 in a single state/jurisdiction

### Enforcement & Penalties

| Tier | Culpability                     | Penalty Range (per violation) | Annual Cap |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1    | Unaware                         | $137–$68,928                  | $2.07M     |
| 2    | Reasonable cause                | $1,379–$68,928                | $2.07M     |
| 3    | Willful neglect (corrected)     | $13,785–$68,928               | $2.07M     |
| 4    | Willful neglect (not corrected) | $68,928–$2.07M                | $2.07M     |

*Figures adjusted for inflation as of 2024*

Criminal penalties (DOJ): up to $250K and 10 years imprisonment for wrongful disclosure with intent to sell or cause harm.

------

### Key Compliance Requirements

1. **Risk Assessment**: documented, comprehensive, periodic
2. **Policies & Procedures**: written, implemented, maintained 6 years
3. **Business Associate Agreements**: mandatory contracts with all vendors touching PHI
4. **Training**: workforce-wide, role-appropriate, documented
5. **Incident Response**: breach identification, containment, investigation, notification procedures
6. **Physical/Technical Controls**: encryption (addressable but effectively required), access management, audit logging

------

### Common Compliance Gaps

- Incomplete or stale risk assessments
- Missing/outdated BAAs
- Inadequate access controls and audit logging
- Lack of encryption for ePHI at rest and in transit
- Insufficient workforce training documentation

Note that HIPAA intersects significantly with litigation holds and legal process—the Privacy Rule permits disclosures pursuant to court orders and subpoenas under specific conditions (45 CFR § 164.512(e)).
